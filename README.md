This project is not main it is just a side project, and is also under construction. It is getting better everyday....

Basic skeleton of this project
The program has hardcoaded arrays of words to practice
* First you manually select the array to use (arrayOfRoots = anyArrayYouWant)
* It generates an array of random nos with the length same as the selectedArray (arrayOfRoots). 
* Then it populates the screen with the generated random indexes
* Also it puts the words in an array called arrayOfWords.
* Then it checks for " "(space) in the input box, which works as submit.
* It takes a word as input, compares it with the word on screen (for more info check code).
